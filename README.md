## ℹ️ Known Issues / First-Time Launch Tip

> **Heads up!**  
If you encounter errors related to **Fuel** or **Inventory** systems when launching the server for the first time, don’t worry — this is normal.

🛠️ **Solution:**  
Simply **restart the server once**, and the issues should be resolved automatically. These errors typically occur only during the very first launch due to initial resource registration or dependency order.
